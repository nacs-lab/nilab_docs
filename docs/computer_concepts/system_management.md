# A Primer on Computer Systems

A basic understanding of computer systems and how they work is essential to understanding how our codebase works *together* in concert and helps debug a multitude of problems when setting up a new computer or control system. It also helps to understand how to add new features to our system. The resources on this are quite scattered and often include too much information or not the right information. Here, we try to distill the key things that will help debug and understand how code talks to each other and is executed. We will approach this issue from a very physics-like perspective and try to understand how "contact" is made between different pieces of code, and how a causal chain of events result from every execution of code.
